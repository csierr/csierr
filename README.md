### Hi there 👋 I'm Catalina

I'm a software engineer passionate about ML, AI, NLP, and building real-world solutions using technology. My journey started with microcontrollers and IoT, and today I focus on creating AI-powered tools and real-time interaction systems.

🔍 You’ll find here some of the projects I’ve been developing in my free time to deepen or put into practice what I’ve been learning. I'm always exploring new ideas!
